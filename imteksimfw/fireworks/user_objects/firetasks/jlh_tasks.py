    to a desired destination. Forwards (other or same) files to subsequent
    Fireworks. Set _files_in and _files out to forward files if parent
    successfull. (TO IMPLEMENT: restarts packmol with restart files)

    For packmol, there are several possible outcomes:
      1. packmol finished successfully. The parent Firework has COMPLETED
         and passed on its output file, suffixed .pdb
      2. packmol finished by reaching the maximum amount of iterations,
         but not converged. The parent Firework has COMPLETED and passed
         on two files suffixed .pdb and .pdb_FORCED. The .pdb might contain
         misplaced, overlapping entities, while .pdb_FORCED should at least
         fulfill the constraints, while violating tolerances. In this case,
         forward .pdb_FORCED instead of .pdb.
      3. packmol died (possibly due to insufficient walltime). It did not
         forward any files, but is marked as FIZZLED. two files suffixed
         .pdb and .pdb_FORCED should reside within the fizzled parent's
         launch dir. Pull these files and forward .pdb_FORCED.

    Both case 2. and 3. would allow restart from restart files.
    However, with sufficient walltime it is unlikely to improve packing.
    More likely, the packing is too dense to ever fulfill tolerance
    constraints.

    Args:
        dest: str
           Destination to store packmol output files
        glob_patterns: (list) of str (optional)
           Patterns for glob.glob to identify outputs to store.
           Default: ('*_restart.pack', '*_packmol.pdb',
                     '*_packmol.pdb_FORCED', '*_packmol.inp')
        forward_glob_patterns: {str: str} or {str: list of str} (optional)
           Files to be forwarded to children, either via a detour if parent
           fizzled, or directly if parent successfull and passed via _files_in.
           If value in key: value pair is list of str, preceding glob patterns
           are given priority. Thus, it is possible to forward some .pdb_FORCED
           file if available, and otherwise a .pdb file.
           Default: {"packmol_pdb" : ["*_packmol.pdb_FORCED", "*_packmol.pdb"]}
